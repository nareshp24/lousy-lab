# lousy-lab

This repository contains the C programs that are to be conducted in the C programming lab. These are meant to enhance the ease of understanding to write code in C language. 

I have added extensive comments to some programs so that it will help a beginner to understand the code without much difficulty (some background is assumed). The programs with extensive comments are named as XXXX_tut.c (short for tutorial).

## Further implementations
- adding remaining lab cycles
- adding more XXXX_tut.c files
- adding sample output to every program
